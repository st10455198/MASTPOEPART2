       This is my food App code where you can choose the meals you want to eat,there are various menu's to choose from like the starters menu,Main dish menu and dessert menu.in this App the home page is where there is a list of the menu list.if you choose starter you will click the pressable rectangle to navigate to where the  defines the meal of your choice and the price of the meal,if you choose to eat the meal you have chosen simply click the cart pressable rectangle to navigate to the cart where you can checkout and order your meal or go back to the menu list to choose another meal.

        I am not certain whether the App runs or not because i cannot access it on my expo but my code does not have any errors.
